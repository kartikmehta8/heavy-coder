## Heavy Coder - The Dream of a Programmer ðŸ’»
Sometimes, finding bugs isn't easy. Programmers used to spend hours finding a minor critical bug & which hampers their productivity. They have to visit numerous websites and documentation & still, they don't have any clue about the problem. 

### The website "Heavy Coder" is the dream of every programmer in the world.

The website facilitates **code completion** by specifying the type of language and the problem the programmer is facing. And not only this, it **recommends YouTube videos** for quick help. The website is integrated with an **iframe** so that the programmers don't need to switch between the tabs, and they can watch the video side by side while understanding the code.
### Aren't you curious? ðŸ˜¬

## How do we build it?
- For the client side, we used **React** to build our web application along with the **Jest** testing framework.
- The designing/styling of the web application is built using **TailwindCSS** and **Lottie Animations**.
- We used packages like Axios and youtube-API for implementing our features.
- For the server side, we used **NodeJS** & **ExpressJS** to make a REST API.
- **Openai's ChatGPT API** is used to turn comments into code.

## Challenges that we faced?
- We don't know much about Artificial Intelligence. So, it was challenging to understand the jargon before we planned our project and proceeded further with it.
- Developing a full-stack application that matches the industry standard was challenging, but we divided our tasks and made it work and function properly.
- As we were new to AI, we had to go through the documentations and stack overflow quite a bit. It was time-consuming. The overall result is fruitful.

## Accomplishments of our project?
- To create an **all-in-one website** for programmers to resolve their doubts.
- We implement **Openai's ChatGPT API** for code completion and present the code.
- The **YouTube API** can send videos related to the user search results and provide a better user experience.
- We use JSON-based animations (**Lottie Animations**) for design.

## What did we learn?
- How to connect **Openai's ChatGPT API** to our website and create a _code completion_ feature?
- How to receive post requests on the server asynchronously and handle **promises**?
- How to use the **Jest** testing library for testing our code?
- How to **collaborate** as a team?

## What's next for Heavy Coder?
- Add a **compiler** so users can write and run the code on our website.
- Perform implementation of live **YouTube video transcript & summary** for people who prefer written editorials using _AssemblyAI_.
- How to make our website **responsive**?
- Add an iframe that supports search results from **Stack Overflow**.
